# Homework | Week 2

In this project, a list of books is created. We first list the list we have created and then find out whether there are books searched in the list.

## Purpose of application

We have a list of books. This application has 2 tasks.
1. To show all the books in the application as output.
2. If there is a book name given as an input, printing it on the screen, if not, printing an output stating that the book does not exist.

## Used Commands

### list command
```
go run main.go list
```
This command allows us to see the objects we define in the application as a list.

### search command 
```
go run main.go search <bookName>
go run main.go search Harry Potter
```
This command allows us to scan the objects we have defined in the application to check if they exist inside the application.
